China provides a tantalising glimpse of Beijing 2022

The Closing Ceremony of any Olympic Games or Olympic Winter Games is an opportunity for celebration and festivity as the host city bids farewell to the world, and the athletes gather to celebrate their achievements. It also offers a platform to the host city of the following edition of the Games to give the world a sneak preview of what it can expect four years down the line.

The Chinese capital, which hosted a hugely successful Olympic Games in 2008, is set to become the first city in history to stage both the Summer and Winter Games. And if the official “teaser” for Beijing 2022 is anything to go by, the next Winter Games will be every bit as spectacular as the 2008 Games were a decade ago.
