Best hummus in Tokyo?

Friend is looking for (store-bought) hummus in Tokyo. To my surprise, absolutely none of the usual import stores I had a look at sell hummus (the kind that comes in a jar and keeps for a while, or even the fresh refrigerated kind). They have literally every sauce and dips ever invented anywhere in the world, but no hummus...

Has anyone seen hummus sold anywhere in Tokyo (outside of middle-eastern restaurants)?

PS: I know it's not that hard to make, but still.
