How To Make Smooth Hummus from Scratch

First, let us mention that this hummus recipe uses tahini. In the hummus-loving world, there are two camps. Some love the zest and deep flavor of tahini added, others could really go without it. We like it both ways, but for the best hummus rivaling our favorite brands in the store, we use this recipe and include tahini.

If you want to make hummus without tahini, simply leave it out. A chickpea pur√©e without it is still quite delicious. Just add more olive oil. Another option is to use a natural unsweetened creamy peanut butter in its place.
